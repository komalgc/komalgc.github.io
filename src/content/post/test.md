![Testing Strategy](/assets/images/posts/testplan.png)

A **test plan** is detailed documentation that attempts to define how we will carry out our testing.

All test planning is based on the **risks** we want to focus on during testing.

Created by **James Bach** as part of the **Heuristic Test Strategy Model**, **SFDIPOT** is designed to help us consider a product from different perspectives.

## SFDIPOT Mnemonic

- **Structure** — What the product is made of
- **Function** — What the product does
- **Data** — What the product processes
- **Interfaces** — Ways in which the product can be interacted with
- **Platform** — What the product depends on
- **Operations** — How the product will be used
- **Time** — How time affects the product

Although this mnemonic can be used at a **strategic level**, we can also apply it to smaller sections or features of a system.

We can use these different types of **perspectives** to re-evaluate the feature under test through different lenses to identify various **risks**.

Once we have identified risks, **prioritizing** what needs to be focused on helps us plan out and define how we will carry out our testing.

It can be documented via **Jira**, **Word**, or by creating **models**.
